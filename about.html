                    I think it's fair to say that personal computers have become the most empowering tool we've ever created. They're tools of communication, they're tools of creativity, and they can be shaped by their user.

                <h1>WPM Definition</h1>
                <div class="footerArticleDiv">
                    WPM means Words Per Minute. It is a measure of the output speed on a
                    keyboard. Here's how it works:
                    <br />- start a timer and start typing for exactly 1 minute
                    <br />- count how many characters you just typed including spaces and
                    punctuation
                    <br />- divide that value by 5 (the WPM system considers a word is 5 keystrokes)
                    <br />- the result is your Words Per Minute speed
